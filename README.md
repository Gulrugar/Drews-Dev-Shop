### MetaObject Designer Pages

Pages about the stores product Designers. These pages are a proof of concept for generating new pages quickly and easily by just creating a new MetaObject and associating it with a new page through a MetaField reference.

In this example a MetaObject Definition is created called Designer with some associated information:

1. Name
2. Short Description
3. Image

Three instances of this definition are created and a page called Designers is associated with a custom template that loops through all the Designer instances and outputs HTML for each.

A page is also created for each instance and associated with another custom template to create individual Designer pages.
